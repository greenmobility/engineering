## How we work

We are doing Scrum with two weeks sprints. https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html

We focus on working as a team, delivering as a team so that each week we can show progress.

We use GitHub for collaboration and Pull Requests are a big part of keeping up productivity. Reviews are requested on code that introduces bigger changes, but it is allowed to merge in code that is green because the person doing it focuses on taking responsibility.
